Notes
- Using for loop, to make the integer in descending order, use range(start, stop, step)
    - if the step in negative, the integer will stop before the stop value
- If you want to multiply two polynomials using numpy, use np.convolve() function
    - when you should compute value of it, use np.polyval() function
- How np.convolve() works:
    - If you have two polynomials, g(x) = 2x^2 + 3 and h(x) = x + 1, the coefficients are:
        - g_coeffs = [2, 0, 3]
        - h_coeffs = [1, 1]
    - To compute the product g(x)*h(x), you can use np.convolve(g_coeffs, h_coeffs)
    - The result will be the coefficients of the resulting polynomial in descending order
- How np.polyval() works:
    - If you have a polynomial with coefficients in descending order, for example, p(x) = 2x^2 + 0x + 3, the coefficients are p_coeffs = [2, 0, 3]
    - To evaluate p(x) at a specific value of x, you can use np.polyval(p_coeffs, x)
- Never forget to check if list is empty
- If you want to differentiate a polynomial using NumPy, you can use the np.polyder() function
