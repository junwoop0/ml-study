Notes
- np.exp() is used to compute the exponential of each element in the input array
- np.sum() computes the sum of array elements over a specified axis
    - ex) np.sum(arr, axis=0) computes the sum along the columns (i.e., for each column)
- To understand the principles of Jacobian matrix of softmax, you should write it down on paper and derive it by hand
- np.diag() creates a diagonal matrix from a 1D array, and np.outer() computes the outer product of two vectors
